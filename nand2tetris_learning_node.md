## Chapter 1 Boolean Functions And Gate Logic

###1.1 boolean logic  
Looking at these laws, remember me of my boolean logic teacher: A tiny lady wearing a large glass...

*Commutative Laws*

* (x And y) = (y And x)
* (x Or y) = (y Or x)

*Associative Laws*

* (x And (y And z)) = ((x And y) And z)
* (x Or (y Or z)) = ((x Or y) Or z)

*Distributive Laws*

* (x And (y Or z)) = ((x And y) Or (x And z))
* (x Or (y And z)) = ((x And z) Or (x And z))

*De Morgan Laws*

* Not(x And y) = Not(x) Or Not(y)
* Not(x Or y) = Not(x) And Not(y)
